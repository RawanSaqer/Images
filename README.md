# Images
1- Reading, Displaying the image and r, g, b channels

2- Converting Color Spaces

3- Resizing,Rescaling preserving aspect ratio,Upscaling,Cropping,Rotation,
Flipping the image or creating mirror image,Warping,Swirl,Pooling the images.

4- Denoising and noise on an image

5- Normalization

6- Weather Transforms

7- Keypoints augmentations  implemented for spatial transformations :
* VerticalFlip
* HorizontalFlip
* Flip
* RandomCrop
* RandomRotate90
* Rotate
* CenterCrop
* RandomSizedCrop
* ShiftScaleRotate

8- Generating SIFT features
* Convert the image to greyscale
* kp is the keypoints
* desc is the SIFT descriptors, they're 128-dimensional vectors that we can use for our final features
