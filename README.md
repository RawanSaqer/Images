# Images
1- Reading, Displaying the image and r, g, b channels

2- Converting Color Spaces

3- Resizing,Rescaling preserving aspect ratio,Upscaling,Cropping,Rotation,
Flipping the image or creating mirror image,Warping,Swirl,Pooling the images.

4- Denoising and noise on an image

6- Normalization

7- Weather Transforms

8- Keypoints augmentations  implemented for spatial transformations :
* VerticalFlip
* HorizontalFlip
* Flip
* RandomCrop
* RandomRotate90
* Rotate
* CenterCrop
* RandomSizedCrop
* ShiftScaleRotate

9- Generating SIFT features
* Convert the image to greyscale
* kp is the keypoints
* desc is the SIFT descriptors, they're 128-dimensional vectors that we can use for our final features

10- Feature Extraction using Daisy Descriptor.

11- Feature extraction using HOG.

12- Python tesseract.

13- Perform a dictionary learning (and atom extraction) from the MNIST dataset.

14- FeatureDetectionUsingConvolution.

15- Reduce data dimensions by building an autoencoder
